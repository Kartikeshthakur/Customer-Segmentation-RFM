**Customer Segmentation using RFM & K-Means**

**Overview:**
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis combined with K-Means clustering on a retail dataset. The goal is to group customers based on purchasing behavior and provide actionable business insights.

**Key Features:**
Data preprocessing and feature engineering of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
Application of K-Means clustering with the Elbow method to determine optimal clusters.
Visualization of customer segments for better interpretation.
Power BI dashboard for interactive business insights.
Well-structured, reproducible Python code and dummy dataset.

**Tech Stack:**
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation
Dataset: Dummy retail dataset with 100 records

**Results & Insights:**
Customers are segmented into distinct groups based on purchase patterns.
High-value customers are identified for retention and loyalty strategies.
Low-frequency customers highlight potential areas for re-engagement.
Provides a scalable framework for real-world customer analytics.

**Business Impact:**
This project demonstrates how businesses can leverage customer segmentation to:
Personalize marketing campaigns.
Improve customer retention.
Optimize sales strategies.
Enhance overall customer lifetime value.
